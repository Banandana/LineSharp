I made this in a few minutes by de-serializing the raw operation type. Operations can be extracted from long polling, and is usually not handled by the end user.

This is for info/debug purposes and has no other value. It's very badly written and undocumented.

USAGE: Open the form and drag files containing a dump of the operation to get the data in readable format.
