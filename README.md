This is a C# implementation of the LINE protocol. It's currently a WORK IN PROGRESS and I've written it entirely on my own. It's been my personal project for over a year, and it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the following people:

 - Lumpio
 - Bandocheman

The actual repository containing some info about the protocol can be found elsewhere.

This implementation is fairly simple. I have another repository that contains an actual example of implementation.

TODO:
 - Finish callbacks on operation functions
 - Figure out how 'secure chat' works and implement that as well
 - Random misc items


Unfortunately, this project was not created with a specific purpose in mind. Because of that, it can be used for many different things, including bots, creation of a custom client, etc.

If there are features you wish to see in this implementation, submit a pull request or ask. It could be simple, or it could be incredibly complex. It's typically the former.
