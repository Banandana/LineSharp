This is a C# implementation of the LINE protocol. It's currently a WORK IN PROGRESS and I've written it entirely on my own. It's been my personal project for over a year, and it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the following people:

Lumpio
Bandocheman

The actual repository containing some info about the protocol can be found elsewhere.

This implementation is fairly simple, as can be seen by the main function in Program.cs.

TODO:

Finish callbacks on operation functions

Figure out how 'secure chat' works and implement that as well

Random misc items


Unfortunately, this project was not created with a specific purpose in mind. Because of that, it can be used for many different things, including bots, creation of a custom client, etc.

If there are features you wish to see in this implementation, submit a pull request or ask. It could be simple, or it could be incredibly complex. It's typically the former.
